        <h4>How do I place an order?</h4>
        <h4>I placed my order; now what?</h4>
        <p>
          Thank you for your order! You’ll receive a confirmation email with the
          details of your order. Now the hard part begins; you'll have to wait
          until pickup day. The location for the pickup varies, but it will be
          specified on the order form. The open hours will also vary but usually
          between 11:00 am and 3:00 pm. On the day of the Pop-Up event, drop by
          the location during the open hours of the Pop-Up, pick up your
          goodies, and enjoy!
        </p>
        <h4>Do you do deliveries?</h4>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, not at this moment, but it could be a possibility once
          the micro-business grows.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you ship outside of Washington?</h4>
        <p>
          Sadly, due to the type of food license, I am not allowed to make sales
          outside of Washington.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you ship within Washington?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! This will be considered a special order; please fill out the
          contact form or email hello@mucarobakingco.com instead of making an
          order if interested.
        </p>
        <h4>I placed an order but didn’t get the confirmation email</h4>
        <p>
          Please allow ___ hours for your confirmation to arrive and check the
          spam/junk folder in your inbox. If you can’t locate it after ____
          hours, please fill out the contact form or email
          hello@mucarobakingco.com.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I walk in during the Pop-up?</h4>
        <p>
          Of course! But preordering is highly recommended to guarantee you’ll
          be able to get your first choice of goodies. The items available to
          buy on the spot will be in limited quantities, and not all the items
          will be available to purchase on the day of the pop-up.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you take special orders?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! Please fill out the contact form or email
          hello@mucarobakingco.com with the details.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I cancel my order?</h4>
        <p>
          Cancellations will be accepted up to a week before the Pop-up event.
          If you need to cancel your order six to four days ahead, please fill
          out the contact form or email hello@mucarobakingco.com. Those will be
          handled on a case-by-case basis. Changes will not be accepted within
          three days of the event.
